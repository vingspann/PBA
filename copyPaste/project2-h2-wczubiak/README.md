# Project2-h2-wczubiak
## Theme
The theme for this handin is Star Wars. This can be seen by my new bot, YODABOT.
The theme is continued with the API that I used, Yoda-Speak. This api converts the text you send it, into a version that sounds like yoda. It also adds little Yoda-esque quirks as well.
## Known Problems
It won't say you're logged in until you enter some text, and there is a chance that first message won't appear.
I'm missing 1 integration test, and 3 Socket IO tests.
## How to Improve
I could change the way I do authentication, to trigger as soon as a user is logged in.
I would like to add the Swapi API to add more Star Wars information available. This would increase the breadth of the theme.
## Improvements from previous handin
* Google Authentication
* Persistance Via Database
* Acknowledgement of disconnected user, and updated User List
